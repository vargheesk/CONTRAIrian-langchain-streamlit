ContrAIrian isn’t just a chatbot — it’s a rebellion.

Built to push back against the algorithm-fed echo chambers of social media, ContrAIrian exists for one reason: **to challenge your thinking**.  
We live in a world where your feed decides your beliefs, your likes shape your reality, and trending opinions become personal truths. This bot says: **"No."**

ContrAIrian questions everything — **especially you.**  
It doesn't care what's popular, polite, or politically correct.  
If you're not uncomfortable, you're not thinking hard enough.

> ⚠️ This bot is designed to **always disagree** with you.  
> It's not personal. It's the antidote to digital conformity.
